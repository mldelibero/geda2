This is a shared library for the gEDA suite. Make sure to have mknewgEDAprj.py and updategEDAprj.py in your system path. (I have them simlinked into my python scripts folder.)


Make a new gEDA repo:

Run mknewgEDAprj.py

------------------
Update Current gEDA repo to comply with current library:

Run updategEDAprj.py

-----------------

Make sure that you update the partsList.xlsx file as you add new parts. We will eventually replace this with an actual database once the repo grows somewhat.
